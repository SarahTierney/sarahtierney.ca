I was lucky to have grown up with two artistic parents in graphic design careers who constantly pushed my creative side. Because of this I had an appreciation for good design from a young age, and that only got stronger as I grew older and more educated in the field.
Having the ability to communicate through design is a gift for me, and I think being presented with challenges and having to look for a creative solution is fun.
